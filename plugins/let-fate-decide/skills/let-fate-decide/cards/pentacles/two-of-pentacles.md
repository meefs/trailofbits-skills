# Two of Pentacles

**Suit**: Pentacles | **Rank**: Two

## Upright
Balance, adaptability, and juggling priorities. Multiple demands compete for
attention, and skillful time management keeps everything in motion.

## Reversed
Overwhelmed, disorganized, and overcommitted. Too many spinning plates lead
to dropped responsibilities and burnout.

## In Technical Context
Juggle the competing priorities. Balance speed and quality—neither can be zero.
