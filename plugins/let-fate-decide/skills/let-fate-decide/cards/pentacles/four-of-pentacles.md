# Four of Pentacles

**Suit**: Pentacles | **Rank**: Four

## Upright
Security, conservation, and control. Holding tightly to what you have out of
fear of loss. Stability maintained through a scarcity mindset.

## Reversed
Greed, materialism, and reluctance to let go. Over-control stifles growth and
prevents necessary change.

## In Technical Context
Don't over-protect or over-abstract. Release your grip on the code and let it
evolve.
