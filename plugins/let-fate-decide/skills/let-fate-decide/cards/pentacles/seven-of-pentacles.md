# Seven of Pentacles

**Suit**: Pentacles | **Rank**: Seven

## Upright
Patience, long-term investment, and perseverance. The work has been done and
now you wait for the harvest. Rewards come to those who endure.

## Reversed
Impatience, poor returns, and frustration. The effort invested feels wasted,
or the temptation to abandon a long-term plan grows.

## In Technical Context
Long-term investment in quality. Write the tests, document the API, build it
right.
