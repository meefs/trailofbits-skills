# Ten of Pentacles

**Suit**: Pentacles | **Rank**: Ten

## Upright
Wealth, inheritance, and legacy. Long-term success that extends beyond the
individual. Building something that endures for those who come after.

## Reversed
Financial failure, loss of legacy, and short-term focus. What was built
crumbles because no one planned for succession.

## In Technical Context
Build for the long term. Think about maintainability, succession, and future
developers.
