# Five of Pentacles

**Suit**: Pentacles | **Rank**: Five

## Upright
Financial loss, insecurity, and hardship. Difficult times and material worry.
Resources are thin and the path forward feels bleak.

## Reversed
Recovery from hardship, spiritual poverty, or accepting help. The worst is
passing, but the scars of scarcity linger.

## In Technical Context
Resources are scarce. Work within constraints rather than wishing for more.
