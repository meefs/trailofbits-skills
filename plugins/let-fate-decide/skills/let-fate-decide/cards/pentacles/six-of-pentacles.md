**Suit**: Pentacles | **Rank**: Six

## Upright
Generosity, charity, and sharing wealth. Giving and receiving in balance.
Resources flow where they are needed most.

## Reversed
Strings attached, debt, and one-sided charity. Generosity with hidden motives
or an imbalance of power in the exchange.

## In Technical Context
Share knowledge and reuse existing work. Open source it or leverage what others
built.
