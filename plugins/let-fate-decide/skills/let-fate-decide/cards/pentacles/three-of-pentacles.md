# Three of Pentacles

**Suit**: Pentacles | **Rank**: Three

## Upright
Teamwork, collaboration, and craftsmanship. Skilled people working together
produce something greater than any individual could. Learning through doing.

## Reversed
Disharmony, misalignment, and working alone. The team is out of sync, or
someone insists on doing everything themselves.

## In Technical Context
This requires collaboration and craft. Code review, pair programming, shared
ownership.
