# Knight of Pentacles

**Suit**: Pentacles | **Rank**: Knight

## Upright
Efficiency, routine, and methodical progress. The most reliable and
conservative of the knights. Steady effort without flash or shortcuts.

## Reversed
Boredom, laziness, and feeling stuck. Methodical progress stalls into
perfectionism or an inability to adapt when the plan needs changing.

## In Technical Context
Slow, steady, reliable progress. No shortcuts—follow the process methodically.
