# Eight of Pentacles

**Suit**: Pentacles | **Rank**: Eight

## Upright
Diligence, mastery, and skill development. Repetitive, detail-oriented work
that builds expertise. The apprentice honing their craft one piece at a time.

## Reversed
Perfectionism, lack of motivation, and scattered focus. The pursuit of mastery
becomes an excuse to never ship, or effort lacks direction.

## In Technical Context
Heads-down, detailed craftsmanship. Focus on getting the implementation exactly
right.
