# Two of Wands

**Suit**: Wands | **Rank**: 2

## Upright
Planning, decisions about direction, future vision. You hold the world in
your hands and must choose a path. Bold decisions now shape what comes next.

## Reversed
Fear of the unknown, poor planning. Indecision keeps you stuck in familiar
territory. You are avoiding the leap that growth requires.

## In Technical Context
Time to plan architecture before coding. Evaluate your options.
