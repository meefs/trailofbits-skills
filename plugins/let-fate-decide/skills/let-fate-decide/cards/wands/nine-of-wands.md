# Nine of Wands

**Suit**: Wands | **Rank**: 9

## Upright
Resilience, persistence, last stand, boundaries. You carry the scars of
effort but remain standing. One final push will see you through.

## Reversed
Exhaustion, giving up, paranoia. Wounds accumulate and the will to continue
fades. Rest before collapse, not after.

## In Technical Context
You're almost done but tired. Push through the last edge cases.
