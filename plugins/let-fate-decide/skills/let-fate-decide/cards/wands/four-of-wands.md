# Four of Wands

**Suit**: Wands | **Rank**: 4

## Upright
Celebration, harmony, milestones, homecoming. A joyful achievement deserves
recognition. The foundation is solid and the community gathers around it.

## Reversed
Lack of harmony, transition, personal celebration. The milestone is reached
but something feels incomplete. Celebrate privately even if others don't notice.

## In Technical Context
Celebrate the milestone. Ship what you have--it's ready.
