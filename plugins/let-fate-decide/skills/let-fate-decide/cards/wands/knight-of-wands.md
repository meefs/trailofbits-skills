# Knight of Wands

**Suit**: Wands | **Rank**: Knight

## Upright
Energy, passion, adventure, impulsiveness. A bold charge forward fueled by
conviction. Action first, questions later.

## Reversed
Haste, delays, frustration, recklessness. Speed without direction causes
collisions. The fire burns out of control without discipline.

## In Technical Context
Move boldly but watch for recklessness. Iterate fast with guardrails.
