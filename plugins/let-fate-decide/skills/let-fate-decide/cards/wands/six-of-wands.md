# Six of Wands

**Suit**: Wands | **Rank**: 6

## Upright
Victory, recognition, success, public acknowledgment. You have earned
your triumph and others see it. Confidence is well-placed after hard work.

## Reversed
Fall from grace, egotism, lack of recognition. Success breeds arrogance or
the win goes unnoticed. Stay grounded regardless of external validation.

## In Technical Context
The approach will succeed. Ship confidently and communicate the win.
