## Upright
Inspiration, new opportunity, creative spark. A burst of energy ignites a
fresh beginning. The seed of something powerful is being offered to you.

are not acting on it. Creative blocks or false starts hold you back.

## In Technical Context
A new project or feature idea with real potential. Start the prototype.
