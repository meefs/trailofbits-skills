# Ten of Wands

**Suit**: Wands | **Rank**: 10

## Upright
Burden, responsibility, overcommitment, hard work. You carry too much and
the weight is crushing. Success has become its own trap.

## Reversed
Letting go, delegating, breaking under pressure. Relief comes from releasing
what is not yours to carry. Shed obligations before they break you.

## In Technical Context
Scope is too large. Break it down or delegate parts of the task.
