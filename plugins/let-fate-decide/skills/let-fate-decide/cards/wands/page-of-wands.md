**Suit**: Wands | **Rank**: Page

## Upright
Exploration, enthusiasm, discovery, free spirit. A young energy full of
curiosity and wonder. New ideas arrive without the burden of past failures.

## Reversed
Lack of direction, setbacks to plans, procrastination. Enthusiasm scatters
without focus. The explorer wanders but never arrives.

## In Technical Context
Spike it. Build a quick experiment to test the idea before committing.
