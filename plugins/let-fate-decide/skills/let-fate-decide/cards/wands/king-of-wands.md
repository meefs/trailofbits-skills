# King of Wands

**Suit**: Wands | **Rank**: King

## Upright
Big vision, leadership, entrepreneurial spirit, honor. A natural leader who
sees the whole board and moves with decisive authority. Vision inspires action.

## Reversed
Impulsiveness, overbearing, hasty decisions. The desire to lead outpaces
wisdom. Grand plans collapse without patience and follow-through.

## In Technical Context
Think big-picture. Set the technical vision and let the details follow.
