# Five of Wands

**Suit**: Wands | **Rank**: 5

## Upright
Competition, conflict, disagreements, tension. Multiple forces clash and
no one is listening. The chaos is unproductive without a unifying direction.

## Reversed
Avoiding conflict, compromise, finding common ground. The tension eases as
parties move toward resolution. Peace comes from choosing cooperation.

## In Technical Context
Competing approaches or team disagreements. Resolve the design debate before
proceeding.
