# Eight of Wands

**Suit**: Wands | **Rank**: 8

## Upright
Speed, swift action, movement, rapid progress. Everything aligns and
momentum carries you forward. Strike while conditions are favorable.

## Reversed
Delays, frustration, waiting, scattered energy. The rush has stalled and
impatience makes things worse. Regroup before pushing ahead.

## In Technical Context
Move fast. This is a straightforward implementation--don't overthink it.
