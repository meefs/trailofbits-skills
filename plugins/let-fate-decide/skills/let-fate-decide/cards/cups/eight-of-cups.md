# Eight of Cups

**Suit**: Cups | **Rank**: 8

## Upright
Walking away, disillusionment, and leaving behind what no longer serves you. Despite investment, you recognize that this path leads nowhere. It takes courage to turn your back on the familiar.

## Reversed
Fear of change, aimless drifting, and avoidance. You know you should leave but cannot bring yourself to act. Clinging to a dead end out of comfort or cowardice.

## In Technical Context
Abandon the current approach—it's not working. Walk away and try something new.
