# Ten of Cups

**Suit**: Cups | **Rank**: 10

## Upright
Harmony, happiness, and complete fulfillment. Everything aligns—heart, mind, and circumstance. This is the emotional culmination, where relationships and efforts reach their ideal state.

## Reversed
Broken harmony, disillusionment, and misalignment. The picture-perfect vision has cracked. Values are at odds with reality, and the dream doesn't match what was built.

## In Technical Context
Full alignment between implementation and requirements. This is the ideal solution.
