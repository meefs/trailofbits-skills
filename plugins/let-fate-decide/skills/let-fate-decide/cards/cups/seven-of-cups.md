# Seven of Cups

**Suit**: Cups | **Rank**: 7

## Upright
Fantasy, illusion, and wishful thinking. Too many choices shimmer before you, each more tempting than the last. Not all that glitters is real—discernment is essential.

## Reversed
Alignment with personal values and becoming grounded. The illusions dissolve and clarity emerges. You finally see which option is real and which was smoke.

## In Technical Context
Too many options causing analysis paralysis. Ground yourself and pick one.
