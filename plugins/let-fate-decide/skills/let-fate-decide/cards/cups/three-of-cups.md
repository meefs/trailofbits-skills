# Three of Cups

**Suit**: Cups | **Rank**: 3

## Upright
Celebration, friendship, and joyful collaboration. The community comes together in shared success. This is a time for collective effort and mutual support.

## Reversed
Overindulgence, gossip, and isolation. The group dynamic has soured, or you've withdrawn from those who could help. Social excess may be masking deeper issues.

## In Technical Context
Involve the team. This is a collaborative effort, not a solo mission.
