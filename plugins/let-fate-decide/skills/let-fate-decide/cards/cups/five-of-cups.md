# Five of Cups

**Suit**: Cups | **Rank**: 5

## Upright
Loss, grief, and regret dominate your attention. You are fixated on what has spilled and failed, blind to what remains. Disappointment clouds your judgment.

## Reversed
Acceptance, moving on, and finding peace. The grieving period ends and you begin to see what was salvaged. Forgiveness—of yourself or others—opens a new path forward.

## In Technical Context
Stop mourning the sunk cost. Three cups remain standing—focus on what works.
