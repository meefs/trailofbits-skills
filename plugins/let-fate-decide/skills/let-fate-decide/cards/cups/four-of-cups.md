# Four of Cups

**Suit**: Cups | **Rank**: 4

## Upright
Apathy, contemplation, and disconnection. You are so focused on what you lack that you miss what is being offered. Reevaluation is needed, but don't let it become paralysis.

## Reversed
Sudden awareness, acceptance, and moving forward. The fog lifts and you finally see the opportunity that was always there. A renewed sense of motivation takes hold.

## In Technical Context
You're overlooking an obvious solution. Step back and look at what's already available.
