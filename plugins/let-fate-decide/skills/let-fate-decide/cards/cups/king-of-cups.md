# King of Cups

**Suit**: Cups | **Rank**: King

## Upright
Emotional balance, control, and diplomatic generosity. The king masters his feelings without suppressing them. He leads with wisdom tempered by genuine compassion.

## Reversed
Emotional manipulation, moodiness, and volatility. Control has curdled into repression or weaponized into coercion. The calm surface hides a turbulent undercurrent.

## In Technical Context
Balance technical excellence with empathy. Mentor the team through this complexity.
