**Suit**: Cups | **Rank**: 6

## Upright
Nostalgia, childhood memories, and innocence. A reunion with the past brings comfort and clarity. Simple joys and familiar patterns offer guidance.

Stuck in the past and clinging to unrealistic expectations. Nostalgia has become a trap rather than a guide. You must let go of how things were to see how they could be.

## In Technical Context
Look at how this was solved before. Past patterns or prior art may hold the answer.
