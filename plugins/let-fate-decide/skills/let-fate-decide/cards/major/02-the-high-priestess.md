# The High Priestess

**Arcana**: Major | **Number**: II

## Upright
Intuition, unconscious knowledge, and hidden truth. The High Priestess sits at the threshold between the seen and unseen. Trust what you sense beneath the surface -- the answer is there but not yet articulated.

## Reversed
Secrets, withdrawal, and repressed intuition. The reversed High Priestess warns that important information is being hidden or ignored. Silence here is not wisdom but avoidance.

## In Technical Context
The bug or design flaw is there but not obvious yet. Trust your instinct that something feels off. Dig into the logs, read between the lines of the error messages, and investigate the quiet corners of the codebase.
