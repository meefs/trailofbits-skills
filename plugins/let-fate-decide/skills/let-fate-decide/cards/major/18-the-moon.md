# The Moon

**Arcana**: Major | **Number**: XVIII

## Upright
Illusion, fear, and the murky subconscious. The Moon casts shadows that distort perception -- things are not what they seem. This card warns that anxiety and uncertainty are clouding judgment, and the path is less dangerous than it appears.

## Reversed
Release of fear, emerging clarity, and truth surfacing. The reversed Moon signals that illusions are fading and reality is becoming visible. What seemed terrifying in the dark is manageable in the light.

## In Technical Context
You do not fully understand the system yet and your assumptions may be wrong. Do not trust the documentation at face value -- write tests, add logging, and verify behavior empirically before building on top of it.
