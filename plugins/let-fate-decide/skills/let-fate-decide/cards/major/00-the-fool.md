# The Fool

**Arcana**: Major | **Number**: 0

## Upright
New beginnings, innocence, and spontaneity. The Fool steps forward without fear, trusting the journey ahead. This card suggests embracing the unknown and taking a leap of faith.

## Reversed
Recklessness, carelessness, and negligence. The reversed Fool rushes in without thinking, ignoring obvious risks. Naivety becomes a liability rather than a strength.

## In Technical Context
Suggests starting fresh -- a greenfield approach or unfamiliar technology. Embrace experimentation, but have a safety net.
