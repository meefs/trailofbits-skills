# Judgement

**Arcana**: Major | **Number**: XX

## Upright
Reflection, reckoning, and awakening to purpose. Judgement calls you to honestly evaluate the past, learn from it, and rise renewed. This card demands a clear-eyed accounting of what worked, what failed, and what you are meant to do next.

## Reversed
Self-doubt, refusal to learn, and harsh self-judgment. The reversed Judgement card either avoids reflection entirely or drowns in it. Neither denial nor self-flagellation produces growth.

## In Technical Context
Conduct a proper retrospective. Review the post-mortem, audit the technical debt, and honestly assess what needs to change. Learn the lesson so you do not repeat the incident.
