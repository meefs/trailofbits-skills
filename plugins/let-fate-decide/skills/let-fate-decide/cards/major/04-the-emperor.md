# The Emperor

**Arcana**: Major | **Number**: IV

## Upright
Authority, structure, and disciplined control. The Emperor brings order from chaos through clear rules and firm boundaries. This card calls for establishing systems, setting standards, and leading with decisive action.

## Reversed
Tyranny, rigidity, and inflexibility. The reversed Emperor demands compliance without reason and resists all change. Structure becomes a cage when it cannot adapt.

## In Technical Context
Establish clear architecture, coding standards, and review processes. The project needs governance and structure right now -- but keep it pragmatic, not authoritarian.
