# The Star

**Arcana**: Major | **Number**: XVII

## Upright
Hope, inspiration, and serene renewal. The Star appears after destruction, offering calm guidance and restored faith. This card says healing is underway -- trust the process and let clarity return naturally.

## Reversed
Despair, disconnection, and loss of faith. The reversed Star has lost sight of the guiding light and feels adrift. Without hope, even good options look bleak.

## In Technical Context
After the incident or the failed launch, take a breath. The path forward exists and the team can recover. Focus on the north star of what you are building and let that guide the rebuild.
