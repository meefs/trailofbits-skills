# The Sun

**Arcana**: Major | **Number**: XIX

## Upright
Joy, success, vitality, and radiant confidence. The Sun shines without reservation, illuminating everything clearly. This card signals a period of energy, clarity, and well-earned success -- things are going well and will continue to.

## Reversed
Diminished joy, sadness beneath the surface, and overconfidence. The reversed Sun warns that excessive optimism may be masking real problems. The light is still there but something is blocking it.

## In Technical Context
The approach is working and the team has momentum. Lean into it -- ship the feature, celebrate the milestone, and build on the success. But do not skip the tests just because things feel good.
