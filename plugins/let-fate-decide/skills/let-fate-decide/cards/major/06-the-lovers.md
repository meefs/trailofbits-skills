# The Lovers

**Arcana**: Major | **Number**: VI

## Upright
Harmony, meaningful choices, and alignment of values. The Lovers represent a crossroads where the decision reflects who you truly are. This card says the choice matters deeply -- pick the option that aligns with your principles.

## Reversed
Disharmony, imbalance, and misalignment. The reversed Lovers signal a mismatch between values and actions, or a partnership that is not working. Avoiding the choice is itself a choice.

## In Technical Context
You face a genuine architectural fork. Evaluate the trade-offs honestly between competing approaches. Pick the one that aligns with the project's long-term values, not the one that is merely expedient.
