# The Chariot

**Arcana**: Major | **Number**: VII

## Upright
Willpower, determination, and hard-won victory. The Chariot charges forward through sheer force of will, holding opposing forces in balance. This card says push through obstacles with focus and discipline.

## Reversed
Lack of direction, scattered effort, and aggression without purpose. The reversed Chariot crashes when willpower becomes stubbornness. Momentum without steering is just a faster way to fail.

## In Technical Context
Push through the hard part. The implementation is tough but achievable with focused effort. Set a deadline, minimize distractions, and ship it -- but make sure you are driving toward the right destination.
