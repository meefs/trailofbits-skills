# The Hierophant

**Arcana**: Major | **Number**: V

## Upright
Tradition, established systems, and conventional wisdom. The Hierophant preserves knowledge and teaches through proven methods. This card advises following established patterns and learning from those who came before.

## Reversed
Rebellion, subversiveness, and challenging the status quo. The reversed Hierophant questions orthodoxy and breaks from tradition. Sometimes the established way is wrong and a new approach is needed.

## In Technical Context
Follow the well-documented, battle-tested approach. Use the standard library, adopt the framework's conventions, and read the RFCs. Now is not the time to be clever.
