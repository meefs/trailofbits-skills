# The Empress

**Arcana**: Major | **Number**: III

## Upright
Abundance, nurturing, and creative growth. The Empress cultivates and sustains, bringing ideas to fruition through patient care. This card suggests fostering what exists rather than forcing something new.

## Reversed
Dependence, smothering, and creative emptiness. The reversed Empress over-invests in one thing at the expense of everything else. Nurturing becomes suffocating when there are no boundaries.

## In Technical Context
Invest in developer experience, documentation, and onboarding. Grow the project by making it welcoming and sustainable, not by adding more features.
