# The Magician

**Arcana**: Major | **Number**: I

## Upright
Manifestation, resourcefulness, and skilled action. The Magician has all the tools needed and knows how to use them. This card says you have everything required to make it happen -- focus your intent and execute.

## Reversed
Manipulation, trickery, and unused potential. The reversed Magician either misuses their talents or fails to use them at all. Cleverness without integrity leads nowhere good.

## In Technical Context
You already have the tools and knowledge to solve this. Stop researching and start building. The answer is in your existing toolkit, not in another dependency.
