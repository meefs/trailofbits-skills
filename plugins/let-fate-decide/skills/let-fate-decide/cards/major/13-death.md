# Death

**Arcana**: Major | **Number**: XIII

## Upright
Endings, transformation, and necessary transition. Death clears away what no longer serves to make room for what comes next. This card does not mean literal death -- it means something must end so something better can begin.

## Reversed
Resistance to change, stagnation, and inability to let go. The reversed Death card clings to what is already gone, refusing the transformation. Decay accelerates when you will not let the dead thing die.

## In Technical Context
Kill the feature, deprecate the API, or delete the legacy code. It served its purpose and now it is holding you back. The longer you keep it on life support, the more it costs.
