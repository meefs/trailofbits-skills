# The Hermit

**Arcana**: Major | **Number**: IX

## Upright
Introspection, solitude, and inner guidance. The Hermit withdraws from noise to find clarity through deep contemplation. This card says step back, reflect, and let understanding come before action.

## Reversed
Isolation, loneliness, and excessive withdrawal. The reversed Hermit retreats too far and loses connection with reality. Solitude becomes avoidance when it has no end.

## In Technical Context
Step away and think deeply before coding. Read the docs, study the problem space, and resist the urge to jump in. The answer will come from understanding, not from typing faster.
