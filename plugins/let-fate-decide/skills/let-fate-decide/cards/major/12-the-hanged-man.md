# The Hanged Man

**Arcana**: Major | **Number**: XII

## Upright
Surrender, letting go, and radical new perspective. The Hanged Man sees the world upside down and finds wisdom in the inversion. This card advises pausing, releasing control, and looking at the problem from a completely different angle.

## Reversed
Delays, resistance to sacrifice, and stalling. The reversed Hanged Man refuses to let go or change perspective, trapped by stubbornness. The pause has become paralysis.

## In Technical Context
Invert your assumptions. If you have been trying to make the data fit the schema, change the schema. If the test keeps failing, maybe the test is right and the code is wrong. Look at it upside down.
