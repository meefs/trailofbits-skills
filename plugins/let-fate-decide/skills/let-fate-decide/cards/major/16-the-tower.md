# The Tower

**Arcana**: Major | **Number**: XVI

## Upright
Sudden upheaval, revelation, and the destruction of false structures. The Tower is struck by lightning and what was built on a weak foundation crumbles. This card says the collapse is necessary -- truth cannot be built on lies.

## Reversed
Fear of change, averting disaster, and delaying the inevitable. The reversed Tower tries to prop up what is already crumbling. You can delay the fall, but the foundation is still broken.

## In Technical Context
Something fundamental about the current approach is wrong. Tear it down and rebuild rather than patching. The outage, the security breach, or the architectural failure is revealing a truth you need to act on.
