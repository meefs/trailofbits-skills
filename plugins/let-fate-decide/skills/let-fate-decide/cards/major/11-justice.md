# Justice

**Arcana**: Major | **Number**: XI

## Upright
Fairness, truth, and cause and effect. Justice weighs evidence impartially and renders a clear verdict. This card demands honesty, accountability, and accepting consequences of past decisions.

## Reversed
Unfairness, dishonesty, and avoiding accountability. The reversed Justice card signals bias, blame-shifting, or a system that rewards the wrong behavior. Someone is not playing fair.

## In Technical Context
Apply rigorous, objective evaluation. Benchmark before choosing, measure before claiming improvement, and hold all options to the same standard. Let the data decide, not opinions or politics.
