# Temperance

**Arcana**: Major | **Number**: XIV

## Upright
Balance, moderation, and purposeful patience. Temperance blends opposing elements into something harmonious through careful, measured action. This card advises finding the middle path and taking a long-term view.

## Reversed
Imbalance, excess, and lack of long-term vision. The reversed Temperance card warns of overindulgence in one direction -- too fast, too much, too soon. Haste and extremes undermine what patience would achieve.

## In Technical Context
Balance speed with quality, features with stability, innovation with reliability. The right answer is probably a measured combination of approaches, not an all-in bet on one extreme.
