# The World

**Arcana**: Major | **Number**: XXI

## Upright
Completion, accomplishment, and wholeness. The World represents the successful end of a cycle -- everything has come together. This card signals fulfillment, integration, and the satisfying close of a chapter before the next begins.

## Reversed
Incompletion, shortcuts, and lingering loose ends. The reversed World warns that the finish line was crossed but the work is not truly done. Declaring victory too early leaves gaps that will haunt you.

## In Technical Context
The project is ready to ship -- or it should be. Tie up the loose ends, write the migration guide, update the changelog, and close the milestone properly. A clean ending sets up a clean beginning.
