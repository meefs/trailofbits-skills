# Wheel of Fortune

**Arcana**: Major | **Number**: X

## Upright
Change, cycles, and decisive turning points. The Wheel spins and what was down comes up -- nothing stays the same forever. This card signals that forces beyond your control are shifting things in a new direction.

## Reversed
Bad luck, resistance to change, and clinging to the old cycle. The reversed Wheel warns against fighting inevitable transitions. The harder you grip the current state, the more painful the change will be.

## In Technical Context
The landscape is shifting -- a new version, a deprecation, a market change. Adapt now rather than later. What worked before may not work going forward, and that is not a failure, it is just the cycle.
