# Strength

**Arcana**: Major | **Number**: VIII

## Upright
Courage, patience, and quiet influence. Strength tames not through force but through compassion and persistence. This card advises gentle determination -- the problem yields to steady, patient effort rather than brute force.

## Reversed
Self-doubt, weakness, and insecurity. The reversed Strength card signals a loss of confidence or trying to force what requires finesse. Raw power without patience makes things worse.

## In Technical Context
The brute-force solution will not work here. Apply patience: profile before optimizing, refactor incrementally, and persuade the team through working examples rather than arguments.
