# Four of Swords

**Suit**: Swords | **Rank**: 4

## Upright
Rest and recuperation after mental exhaustion. Contemplation and solitude restore clarity. Step back from the battle to regain your strength.

## Reversed
Restlessness and burnout from refusing to pause. Pushing through exhaustion leads to diminishing returns. The mind demands rest it is not getting.

## In Technical Context
Take a break before continuing. Rest and return with fresh eyes.
