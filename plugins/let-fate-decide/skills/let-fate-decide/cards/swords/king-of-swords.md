# King of Swords

**Suit**: Swords | **Rank**: King

## Upright
Intellectual power and authority grounded in truth. Clear thinking and fair judgment command respect. Logic and evidence guide every decision with precision.

## Reversed
Manipulative and tyrannical misuse of intellectual power. Authority wielded without fairness or compassion. The mind becomes a weapon against others rather than a tool for truth.

## In Technical Context
Apply rigorous analytical thinking. Let logic and evidence drive the decision.
