# Knight of Swords

**Suit**: Swords | **Rank**: Knight

## Upright
Ambition and determination charge forward at full speed. Fast thinking and decisive action cut through obstacles. The drive to succeed overpowers hesitation.

## Reversed
Reckless action without direction or regard for consequences. Restlessness leads to scattered energy and unfinished work. Speed without purpose causes collateral damage.

## In Technical Context
Charge ahead with the implementation. Speed matters here—refine later.
