# Queen of Swords

**Suit**: Swords | **Rank**: Queen

## Upright
Perceptive, clear-thinking, and fiercely independent. Direct communication cuts through pretense and ambiguity. Wisdom earned through experience sharpens every word.

## Reversed
Coldness and bitterness replace clarity. Emotions overwhelm rational thought, or rationality suppresses necessary feeling. Sharp words wound rather than illuminate.

## In Technical Context
Be precise and direct. Write clear code, clear commits, clear docs. No ambiguity.
