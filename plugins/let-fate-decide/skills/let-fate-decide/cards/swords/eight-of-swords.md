# Eight of Swords

**Suit**: Swords | **Rank**: 8

## Upright
Feeling trapped, restricted, and imprisoned by circumstances. Self-limiting beliefs create walls that aren't really there. The bindings are looser than they appear.

## Reversed
A new perspective breaks the illusion of captivity. Self-acceptance frees you from mental prison. The constraints were never as real as they seemed.

## In Technical Context
You're more constrained than you need to be. Question the assumptions limiting your approach.
