# Two of Swords

**Suit**: Swords | **Rank**: 2

## Upright
A difficult choice between two seemingly equal options creates a stalemate. Avoidance and indecision keep you frozen. The blindfold must come off before progress can be made.

## Reversed
Information overload makes the decision even harder. Indecision deepens into confusion. The cost of not choosing grows by the minute.

## In Technical Context
Two equally valid options and you're stuck. Gather more data or just pick one and commit.
