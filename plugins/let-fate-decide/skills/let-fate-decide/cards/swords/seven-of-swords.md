# Seven of Swords

**Suit**: Swords | **Rank**: 7

## Upright
Deception, stealth, and strategic maneuvering. Someone is getting away with something through cleverness rather than honesty. A shortcut that avoids confrontation but carries risk.

## Reversed
Coming clean and letting conscience guide you. Confession and honesty replace cunning. The deception unravels and truth surfaces.

## In Technical Context
Watch for hidden assumptions or shortcuts that seem clever but will bite you later.
