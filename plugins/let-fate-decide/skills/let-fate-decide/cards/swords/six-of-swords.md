# Six of Swords

**Suit**: Swords | **Rank**: 6

## Upright
Transition and moving on toward calmer waters. Leaving behind what no longer serves you. The journey is quiet and bittersweet, but necessary.

## Reversed
Resistance to change keeps you anchored to the past. Unfinished business and emotional baggage weigh you down. The crossing is delayed but cannot be avoided forever.

## In Technical Context
Migrate away from the old approach. The transition will be uncomfortable but necessary.
