**Suit**: Swords | **Rank**: 9

## Upright
Anxiety, worry, and fear keep you awake at night. Overthinking spirals into nightmares about what might go wrong. The mind tortures itself with worst-case scenarios.

## Reversed
Hope returns as despair loosens its grip. Reaching out to others brings comfort and perspective. Recovery from anxiety begins with a single honest conversation.

## In Technical Context
You're catastrophizing. The worst case isn't as bad as you think. Ship it.
