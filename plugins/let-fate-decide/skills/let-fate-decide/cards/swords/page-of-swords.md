**Suit**: Swords | **Rank**: Page

## Upright
Curiosity and mental energy drive a thirst for knowledge. Restless and eager, full of new ideas and questions. The mind is sharp but lacks experience to temper its edge.

## Reversed
Deception and manipulation replace honest inquiry. All talk and no action—ideas without follow-through. Cunning used for the wrong purposes.

## In Technical Context
Investigate before implementing. Read the source, check the docs, understand the system.
