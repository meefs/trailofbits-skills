# Five of Swords

**Suit**: Swords | **Rank**: 5

## Upright
Conflict and disagreement where winning comes at too high a cost. Competition turns toxic and the victory feels hollow. Someone walks away defeated and resentful.

## Reversed
Reconciliation after conflict becomes possible. Forgiveness opens the door to moving forward. The desire to be right gives way to the desire for resolution.

## In Technical Context
Winning the argument isn't worth it. Find the solution everyone can live with.
