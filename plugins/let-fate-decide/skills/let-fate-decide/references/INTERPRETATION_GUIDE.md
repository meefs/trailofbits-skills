# Interpretation Guide

How to read a 4-card Tarot spread and map it to technical decisions.

## The Spread Positions

| Position | Role | Maps To |
|----------|------|---------|
| 1 - Context | The nature of the situation | Problem domain, current state, what's really being asked |
| 2 - Challenge | The tension or obstacle | Technical debt, ambiguity, constraints, competing requirements |
| 3 - Guidance | The recommended approach | Architecture pattern, methodology, tool choice, strategy |
| 4 - Outcome | Where this path leads | Expected results, what success looks like, long-term effects |

## Reading the Cards

### Step 1: Read Each Card File

For each drawn card, read its meaning file. Note both the upright and reversed meanings. Use whichever matches the card's orientation in the draw.

### Step 2: Map to Context

Translate the card's archetypal meaning into the current technical situation:

**Major Arcana** represent big-picture forces:
- Architectural decisions, paradigm shifts, fundamental approaches
- These carry more interpretive weight

**Minor Arcana** represent practical details:
- **Wands** (fire): Action, initiative, creativity, velocity, building
- **Cups** (water): Collaboration, user experience, intuition, satisfaction
- **Swords** (air): Analysis, logic, debugging, cutting through complexity, hard truths
- **Pentacles** (earth): Quality, craft, reliability, testing, maintenance, tangible results

**Court Cards** can represent approaches or roles:
- **Page**: Learning, experimenting, prototyping, beginner's mind
- **Knight**: Focused pursuit, rapid movement, single-minded effort
- **Queen**: Mastery with empathy, nurturing growth, mature judgment
- **King**: Authority, established patterns, proven approaches

### Step 3: Synthesize the Story

Read all 4 positions as a narrative:

1. "The situation is really about [Card 1]..."
2. "The challenge here is [Card 2]..."
3. "The cards suggest [Card 3] as the approach..."
4. "This leads toward [Card 4]..."

### Step 4: Make a Decision

The reading should bias you toward one of the viable approaches. State:
- Which approach the reading supports
- How specific cards influenced the choice
- What the reading suggests you should watch out for

## Reversed Cards

Reversed cards don't mean "bad." They indicate:
- The energy is internalized rather than expressed
- The quality is blocked, delayed, or needs extra attention
- An alternative or inverted interpretation applies
- Shadow aspects of the card's theme

## Special Patterns

### Multiple Major Arcana
The situation is more significant than it appears. Take extra care with the decision.

### All One Suit
Strong thematic message:
- All Wands: Focus on action and momentum
- All Cups: Focus on user needs and team dynamics
- All Swords: Focus on analysis and clear thinking
- All Pentacles: Focus on craft and practical quality

### All Reversed
Something is being overlooked. Step back and reconsider assumptions before proceeding.

### Court Card Progression
If multiple court cards appear in sequence (Page, Knight, Queen, King), the reading suggests a journey from exploration to mastery.

## What the Reading Is NOT

- Not a substitute for requirements gathering when requirements are gettable
- Not permission to ignore best practices
- Not a way to avoid thinking critically
- Not deterministic (it's entropy, that's the point)

The reading adds a creative nudge to break analysis paralysis. The cards don't make the decision; they give you a direction to explore when you otherwise have none.
